# Loan Approval Prediction Using Logistic Regression

A supervised machine learning project that predicts whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant information, using logistic regression. This project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results, making it suitable for both academic and real-world applications.

##  Project Overview

This project is a classification task that uses logistic regression to automate the loan approval process. The goal is to assist financial institutions in making more data-driven lending decisions.

##  Use Case

Financial institutions can use this model as a baseline to assess loan eligibility and streamline the approval process.

##  Dataset

- **Source**: `loan_approval_dataset.csv`
- **Features**: Applicant income, education, credit history, marital status, loan amount, and more
- **Target Variable**: `Loan_Status` (Approved / Not Approved)

---

##  Technologies & Tools

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- pandas, numpy
- matplotlib, seaborn
- LaTeX (for report)

---

##  Workflow

1. Data exploration and cleaning
2. Feature encoding and scaling
3. Splitting into training and test sets
4. Training a logistic regression model
5. Evaluating model performance
6. Exporting a professional PDF report using LaTeX

##  Model Performance

- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Precision / Recall / F1-score**
- **ROC Curve & AUC Score**

The model shows strong performance for binary classification and serves as a solid baseline.

##  Report

A full project report has been written using LaTeX, including:

- Objective and background
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Conclusion and recommendations

You can find the PDF in the `/report` directory.

##  Future Improvements

- Test more advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Perform hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- Deploy the model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit
